# LeetCode Tracker

### Setup 

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will set up a clean Python environment with all the necessary dependencies for the LeetCode Tracker.

### Usage

To start the app, simply run: 

```
python start_app.py
```

I won't spoil the fun, but you'll find the features you need and if you want extra features, just ask Claude!
